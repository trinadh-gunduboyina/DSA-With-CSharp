# \# DSA With C# – Daily Problem Solving Series

# 

# Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) daily practice repo using C#  

# This project is focused on solving common DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank using clean and efficient C# implementations.

#

# \## How to Run the Solutions

# 

# Each solution is a complete `.cs` file that can be executed in a console project.

# 

# \### Run with .NET CLI

# 

# 1\. Create a new console app if needed:

# 

# ```bash

# dotnet new console -n MyDSAApp

# cd MyDSAApp

# Replace Program.cs with the desired solution file

# 

# Run it:

# 

# bash

# Copy code

# dotnet run
